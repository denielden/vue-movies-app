# Vue Movies app
> My first Vue app!
### Created entirely from scratch.

- Search for movies and TV series to watch
- Sort by different criteria
- Save the best in localStorage
- See details of movies saved
- Dark / light mode
- API data

## Structure of the project

The `main.js` handles `API` calls through Vue while `Vanilla javascript` takes care of the responsive design management.

Source data from `API` of [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/imdb8/).
